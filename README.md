# Chat App
Welcome to my Chat App! This project showcases my ability to build a functional and user-friendly chat application using Android, Kotlin and Firebase.

# Key Features
*Firebase Authentication*
I implemented Firebase Authentication to handle user sign-in and sign-up using phone numbers. The app verifies phone numbers via OTP, ensuring secure and straightforward authentication.

User Management
The app allows users to create an account with their name and phone number. User information is stored in Firebase Realtime Database, making it easy to manage user data and ensure seamless user experience.

Real-Time Chat
Users can send and receive messages in real-time. Firebase Realtime Database ensures that messages are updated instantly, providing a smooth and responsive chat experience.

RecyclerView Integration
I used RecyclerView to display lists of users and chat messages. This allows for efficient display and scrolling of large datasets, enhancing the app's performance and user experience.

Custom Adapters
Custom adapters for users and chat messages ensure that the UI components are reusable and maintainable. The adapters handle data binding and user interactions seamlessly.

Jetpack View Binding
I leveraged Jetpack View Binding to simplify UI code. View Binding reduces the need for findViewById calls and makes the code more readable and less error-prone.

Error Handling
Proper error handling is implemented throughout the app. Users are informed of any issues, such as invalid OTPs or network errors, via Toast messages, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Data Persistence
User sessions are managed efficiently. Once logged in, users remain authenticated even after closing the app, thanks to FirebaseAuth's session management.

# Conclusion
This chat app demonstrates my ability to build a functional and responsive Android application with real-time features using Firebase. It emphasizes user authentication, real-time data updates, and a clean user interface. I enjoyed working on this project and hope it serves as a useful tool and learning resource for others.
